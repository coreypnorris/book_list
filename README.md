##Book list

####I built this app following a [CodeSchool tutorial](https://www.codeschool.com/code_tv/soup-to-bits-warming-up-with-ember), but with a Rails back-end instead of the Ember.js fixtures they used in the video.

It's an app for displaying book reviews. Allows for sorting books by genre, links to each book's Amazon page, and display of each book's cover art.
